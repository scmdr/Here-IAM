# Here-IAM
 6-month IAM (Identity and Access Management) pivot plan, structured for maximum impact with minimal fluff. Follow this ruthlessly to go from beginner to job-ready:

Phase 1: Learn IAM (Months 1–3)
Goal: Master fundamentals + hands-on skills in a specific ecosystem.

Week 1–4: Pick Your Ecosystem
Cloud (AWS/Azure): Focus on native IAM tools (AWS IAM, Azure AD).

Enterprise (Okta, Ping Identity): Learn SSO, MFA, and directory services.

Open Source (Keycloak, FreeIPA): Deploy and configure self-hosted IAM.

Daily Tasks:

Study Core Concepts:

Authentication (OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect).

Authorization (RBAC, ABAC, least privilege).

Directory services (LDAP, Active Directory).

Resources: Auth0 Docs, AWS IAM Best Practices.

Lab Everything:

AWS: Create IAM roles/policies, enforce MFA, set up AWS SSO.

Azure: Configure Conditional Access, integrate with SaaS apps.

Keycloak: Deploy on Docker, connect to a PostgreSQL DB.

Project:

Build a Secure SaaS App: Use AWS Cognito or Auth0 for user authentication.

Deliverable: A GitHub repo with Terraform/IaC code for IAM policies.

Week 5–8: Real-World Frameworks
Compliance: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX.

Tools: SailPoint, CyberArk (free trials).

Frameworks: NIST SP 800-63, ISO/IEC 27001.

Daily Tasks:

Break Down IAM Policies:

Analyze how Netflix enforces least privilege.

Simulate Attacks:

Use PACU to exploit AWS IAM misconfigurations.

Project:
Audit a Cloud Environment: Use AWS Access Analyzer or Azure AD Access Reviews.

Deliverable: A report highlighting overprivileged roles and remediation steps.

Week 9–12: Automate & Scale
Tools: Github Action, Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines.

Concepts: Just-In-Time (JIT) access, SCIM provisioning.

Daily Tasks:

Automate User Lifecycle:

Write a Python script to deprovision users via Okta API.

Break Something:

Lock yourself out of an AWS account, then recover using break-glass procedures.

Project:

Build a Zero Trust Lab: Use Cloudflare Access or Google BeyondCorp.

Deliverable: A video demo of secure access to internal apps without VPN.

Phase 2: Build & Show Your Work (Months 4–5)
Goal: Become visible as a problem-solver.

Week 1–4: Teach Publicly
Daily Tasks:

Post 1 LinkedIn/Twitter thread weekly (e.g., “How I hacked my own AWS account”).

Write a blog post breaking down IAM policies (e.g., “AWS S3 Bucket Policies Gone Wrong”).

Tools: Canva for diagrams, Hashnode for blogging.

Example Post:

“🚨 AWS IAM Fail: I gave an S3 bucket * permissions.
Result: $5k bill overnight.
Fix: Use conditions like aws:SourceIp.
Lesson: Never trust Resource: *.”

Week 5–8: Document Projects
Portfolio Ideas:

GitHub: Terraform modules for secure IAM roles.

Case Study: How you fixed an OAuth2 misconfiguration.

Checklist: “10 IAM Audit Steps Every Engineer Needs.”

Project:

Create a “IAM Hardening Guide”: Share it on Reddit’s r/aws or r/cybersecurity.

Week 9–12: Network Relentlessly
Daily Tasks:

Comment on 3 IAM-related LinkedIn posts/day (add value, don’t spam).

DM 5 IAM engineers/month with specific questions (e.g., “How do you handle JIT access at scale?”).

Communities: Cloud Security Alliance, IAM Discord groups.

Phase 3: Position Yourself for a Job (Month 6)
Goal: Make recruiters chase you.

Week 1–2: Optimize LinkedIn
Headline: “IAM Specialist | Securing Cloud Identities” (not “Looking for roles”).

Content:

Pin your best IAM project.

Add skills: “AWS IAM,” “Azure AD,” “Zero Trust.”

Engagement: Post 2x/week (e.g., “Why IAM is the backbone of DevOps”).

Week 3–4: Apply Strategically
Target Roles:

Cloud IAM Engineer

Identity Security Analyst

IAM Consultant

Resume Tips:

Highlight projects over certs (e.g., “Reduced AWS overprivileged roles by 80%”).

Use metrics: “Automated user deprovisioning, saving 20hrs/month.”

Week 5–6: Ace Interviews
Prep Questions:

“How would you design IAM for a multi-account AWS org?”

“Explain SAML vs. OAuth2.”

“Walk me through troubleshooting a broken SSO integration.”

Mock Interviews: Practice with Pramp or Interviewing.io.

Tools & Resources
Free Labs: AWS IAM Workshop, Azure AD Labs.

Certs: AWS Certified Security Specialty, Certified Identity Professional (CIP).

Books: AWS Security by Dylan Shields.

Why This Works
IAM is 80% practice, 20% theory: Hiring managers care if you can debug SAML flows, not recite RFCs.

Visibility = Opportunity: Most IAM engineers are quiet builders. You’ll stand out by teaching.

Jobs Are Plentiful: 70% of cloud breaches stem from IAM misconfigurations. Companies are desperate.

Final Tip: Start a “brag doc” tracking every IAM win (e.g., “Fixed Azure Conditional Access policy blocking 100+ phishing attempts”). Use it in interviews to shut down imposter syndrome.
